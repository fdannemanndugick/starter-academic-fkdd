Our research team at [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/) is always looking for students and postdocs interested in geophysics, seismoacoustics and explosion monitoring.  We offer both year-round and summer internship options, with opportunities for remote work.  Interns are hired through the Monitoring Systems and Technology Internship Center.  Look for open postings [here](https://www.sandia.gov/careers/career-possibilities/students-and-postdocs/internships-co-ops/institute-programs/monitoring-systems-and-technology-intern-center/) or feel free to reach out to me directly via email.  

As of November 2022 our department is hiring (6) positions for the summer of 2023.  I am looking for two students, one to focus on extending regional infrasound yield estimates using scaling relationships and the other to focus on building seismoacoustic catalogs of low magnitude tectonic events.  Apply via the links above.
